Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression
Overview

This GitHub repository presents a logistic regression-based prediction model for determining survival on the Titanic. The analysis is implemented in Python, leveraging essential data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the project, covering data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Contents

    Notebook: The core analysis is available in the Jupyter notebook (Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb).

    Dataset: The dataset (titanic_train.csv) contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including survival status.

Key Steps

    Data Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis.

    Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and impute missing age values based on passenger class.

    Feature Engineering: Create dummy variables for categorical features like sex and embarked.

    Model Building: Utilize Scikit-learn to build a logistic regression model for survival prediction.

    Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using classification reports and confusion matrices.
